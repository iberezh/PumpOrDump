📜 Technical Specification — Crypto Trend Prediction Game

🧩 Project Overview
Build a web application where registered users predict whether popular cryptocurrencies (e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana) will increase or decrease in price over a selected time window (default 1 hour). Users submit predictions, and after the prediction period, the system evaluates the accuracy against real market data, awarding or deducting points accordingly. A leaderboard ranks users by their total points, fostering competition.

🔍 Functional Requirements
1. User Management
Users must register with username, email, and password.

Passwords stored hashed (bcrypt or equivalent).

Login returns JWT token for authenticated requests.

Auth middleware protects all user-specific routes.

Users can view and update their profile (email, username).

2. Crypto Market Data
Fetch real-time crypto prices from CoinGecko API every minute.

Support at least 5 popular coins: BTC, ETH, SOL, ADA, BNB.

Cache latest price data in memory or DB for fast reads.

Display current price, 24h change %, and timestamp.

3. Prediction Submission
Authenticated users can submit predictions: select coin + direction (up/down) + time window (1h default).

Restrict to max 5 predictions per user per day (configurable).

Store timestamp of prediction submission.

4. Prediction Resolution
Every hour, a scheduled job runs:

For each prediction older than the selected window, fetch the price at prediction time and current price.

Determine if the prediction was correct (price moved in predicted direction).

Mark prediction as resolved with result: win or lose.

Update user’s total score: +10 points for correct, -5 points for incorrect.

Notify user (via UI update; email notification optional).

5. Leaderboard
Show top 10 users sorted by score (descending).

Display username, score, and win rate (percentage of correct predictions).

6. Prediction History
Users can see their own predictions: coin, direction, timestamp, result, points earned/lost.

Paginated list with filters (e.g., resolved/unresolved).

🎨 Visual / UX Requirements
Login/Register pages: clean forms, client-side validation, error feedback.

Dashboard:

Show real-time coin data in a table or cards with prices and 24h change.

Prediction form with dropdown for coins, radio buttons for direction, dropdown for time window.

Leaderboard page: top users displayed with avatars (optional), scores, and win rates.

Responsive design: fully usable on desktop and mobile, with collapsible menus and readable fonts.

Feedback & loading states: show spinners or placeholders during API calls, success/error messages for actions.

Accessibility: semantic HTML, ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation support.
